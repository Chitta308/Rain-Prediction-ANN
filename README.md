# Rain-Prediction-ANN
This repository contains a Rain Prediction project using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The model predicts whether it will rain based on weather-related features such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and others. The goal is to provide an accurate and efficient machine learning solution for weather forecasting.
